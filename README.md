# ESG-rating
The core objective of this project is to utilize large language models (LLMs) to identify the rating differences among various companies in the ESG (environment, society, governance) domain. This is achieved by conducting in-depth analysis of the ESG reports issued by the companies and assigning scores to the existing rating discrepancies.
